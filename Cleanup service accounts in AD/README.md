# What is a service account?

A service account in Active Directory (AD) is a type of account created to run applications, services, or automated tasks instead of regular user accounts. These accounts are typically not used for interactive logins like normal user accounts and are often tied to a specific application or service, such as a web server, database, or scheduled task.
