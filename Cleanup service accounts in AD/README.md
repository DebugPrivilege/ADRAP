# What is a service account?

A service account in Active Directory (AD) is a type of account created to run applications, services, or automated tasks instead of using regular user accounts. They are typically not used to log in interactively to a system like a normal user account, and are often tied to a specific application or service, such as a web server, database, or scheduled task.
