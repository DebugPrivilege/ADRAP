# ADRAP
Active Directory Risk Assessment Program (ADRAP) was a service provided by Microsoft Premier Field Engineers (PFEs) under the Premier Support contract. It involved a  evaluation of an organization's Active Directory (AD) environment to identify potential risks and provide remediation guidance. The assessment focused on various aspects of AD, including operational processes, replication, site topology, domain controller health, and security configurations.

I've decided to repurpose its name and develop my own version, focusing more on the remediation aspect. While there are plenty of tools and scripts available that identify weaknesses in AD, few provide clear guidance on how to address and fix them.
